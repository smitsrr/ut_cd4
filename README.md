So stoked for this analysis! 

Finally got a shape file with the same precinct IDs as the county election results file (for UT county at least). 

Mad thanks to the folks at [Open Elections](http://www.openelections.net/results/) for all of their hard work parsing election data at the precinct level!


On a separate tab to show the correlation between races:
- Ben on x-axis
- chosen race on y - color the dots by county, size of dots by number of votes. 

Further questions
 - does each year, and each county have the number of registered voters?
- instead of making the reader switch years, go ahead and plot changes in behavior over time. 

If I really want to show Utah's blue wave - i should really bring in all of the counties. especially Shireen's district.

Things i want to correlate: 
- Presidential Election v. Ben. 
- local state house rep DEM v. Ben
- Average/median age in precinct

after looking at the census shape files, blocks are too small (and we could only get 2010 data), and block groups are a little too big, but probably the best option. 

Correlate the two map layers. then I'll want to somehow correlate the information in the shapes. 

side by siide maps of median age, minority, income, education, with Ben's vote. You would expect it to follow the national trend. 

opportunities - went for prop 2,
