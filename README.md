So stoked for this analysis! 

Finally got a shape file with the same precinct IDs as the county election results file (for UT county at least). 

Mad thanks to the folks at [Open Elections](http://www.openelections.net/results/) for all of their hard work parsing election data at the precinct level!


On the map I want to just have a ton of different layer options:
- % vote for ben
- % vote for other interesting races (the propositions)

On a separate tab to show the correlation between races:
- Ben on x-axis
- chosen race on y - color the dots by county, size of dots by number of votes. 

Further questions
 - does each year, and each county have the number of registered voters?
- instead of making the reader switch years, go ahead and plot changes in behavior over time. 

If I really want to show Utah's blue wave - i should really bring in all of the counties. especially Shireen's district.
