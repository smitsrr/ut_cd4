Mad thanks to the folks at [Open Elections](http://www.openelections.net/results/) for all of their hard work parsing election data at the precinct level!

Notes to self:
If I really want to show Utah's blue wave - i should really bring in all of the counties. especially Shireen's district. 


Things i want to correlate: 
- Presidential Election v. Ben. 
- Average/median age in precinct

after looking at the census shape files, blocks are too small (and we could only get 2010 data), and block groups are a little too big, but probably the best option. 

Correlate the two map layers. then I'll want to somehow correlate the information in the shapes. 

side by side maps of median age, minority, income, education, with Ben's vote. You would expect it to follow the national trend. 

Besides the opportunity of local versus national races, we could look at the number of registered voters by precinct. If there is lowewr voter turnout in SL county, that presents an opportunity.
