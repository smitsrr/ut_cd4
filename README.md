So stoked for this analysis! 

Finally got a shape file with the same precinct IDs as the county election results file (for UT county at least). 

Mad thanks to the folks at [Open Elections](http://www.openelections.net/results/) for all of their hard work parsing election data at the precinct level!


next thing I want to do is look at total votes (or voter turnout) in 2016 compared to 2018.  

Plot voter turnout in 2016 v 2018, or change in number of registered voters in a precinct (% change?)

On the map I want to just have a ton of different layer options:
- % vote for ben
- % vote for other interesting races (the propositions)

On a separate tab to show the correlation between races:
- Ben on x-axis
- chosen race on y - color the dots by county, size of dots by number of votes.
